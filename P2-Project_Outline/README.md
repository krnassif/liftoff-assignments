## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We are creating a garden planner app that will help users plan the layout of their garden, read information on companion planting and succession planting, and more. Users will be able to create an account to easily keep track of this information. The app helps people organize their gardening plans, learn information about gardening, and overall takes a lot of the guess work out of gardening. This app will be helpful for both new and seasoned gardeners.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create an account to store information about their own garden, favorite plants, saved search preferences, etc. 

Seed price lookup: Users can search seed prices and choose ones that fits their budget.

Sort/filters: Users can look through available plants and filter the results based on things like shade tolerance, watering needs, etc. This will help them choose the best plants for them. 

### Technologies
We will use JavaScript, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Thymeleaf to build our app. 

### What I'll Have to Learn
We will need to learn how to pull data from an API for the seed prices and plant info.
